- Practiced boolean filtering and SQL-like querying using df.query()

### Day 4 – Pandas Data Cleaning & Transformation

- Learned handling missing values, duplicates, data type conversion, and string operations

- Practiced data transformation, sorting, renaming, reordering columns, and index management

### Day 5 – API Data Collection & Web Scraping

- Learned how to fetch data from public APIs using requests and convert JSON responses into Pandas DataFrames

- Practiced web scraping using requests + BeautifulSoup to extract, clean, and store structured data into CSV files

### Day 6 – Pagination Scraping & Data Extraction

- Learned how to scrape multiple web pages using pagination and automatically stop when no more pages are found

- Practiced extracting specific content (quotes, authors, tags), filtering data based on conditions, and storing results in Pandas DataFrames


### Day 7 – Data Visualization with Matplotlib

- Practiced basic plotting using NumPy and Matplotlib

- Created histograms with custom bins and multiple datasets

- Visualized data using box plots and stack plots

- Learned to add labels, legends, grids, and reference lines

### Day 8 – Advanced Matplotlib & Plot Styling

- Built subplots using both procedural and OOP Matplotlib approaches

- Compared datasets using line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts

- Applied plot styling, themes, annotations, and color maps

- Saved figures and improved layout using tight_layout()



### Day 9 - Introduction to Seaborn & Relational Plots

- Explored the Seaborn library for statistical data visualization

- Loaded built-in datasets like tips and flights

- Created relational plots with sns.relplot:

- Scatter plots with multiple dimensions (hue, size, style)

- Line plots to show trends over variables

- Practiced line plots using both Seaborn and Matplotlib

- Learned to add markers, legends, and customize axes


### Day 10 – Advanced Seaborn & Matplotlib Visualizations

- Visualized distributions with sns.histplot and overlayed mean lines

- Explored categorical plots:

- Bar plots (sns.barplot)

- Box plots (sns.boxplot) with hue separation

- Worked with matrix-style plots:

- Pivoted flights data to create heatmaps (sns.heatmap)

- Annotated heatmaps with values and customized color maps

- Applied best practices in Matplotlib:

- Titles, axis labels, grids, legends, tight layout adjustments

- Combined Seaborn plots with Matplotlib axes for greater control

- Built composite figures:

- Multiple subplots using plt.subplots()

- Histograms with KDE, vertical lines for mean, customized axes

- Analyzed real-life datasets visually:

- penguins dataset: scatter plots of flipper_length_mm vs body_mass_g

- tips dataset: pivot tables and heatmaps for average tip by day and time
